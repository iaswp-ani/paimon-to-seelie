# Paimon to Seelie Achievement Conversion

Script for transferring Genshin achievements from paimon.moe to seelie.me

This works by converting the export format of Paimon site to Seelie site, only for Achievements. Importing will also overwrite everything on Seelie site, so only do so if your Seelie site profile is empty (i.e. you never used it before).

Why? Paimon dot moe has had some issues with Achievements. Some duplicated and incorrect achievements have been present.
